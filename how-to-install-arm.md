To install AOSC OS on ARM devices...
====================================

There really isn't any set ways that AOSC OS can be installed on different ARM
devices, so this page serves as a index to guide you to various other guides for
specific devices.

Please refer to our ARM Board Support Package [Wiki](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aosc-os-arm-bsps/wiki) for more information on devices that AOSC OS currently supports, and guides to install AOSC OS on them.
